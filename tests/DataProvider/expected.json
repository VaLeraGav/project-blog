[{"title":"What to read this weekend: The friends you make in the apocalypse","text":"These are the new releases that caught our attention this week: a (surprisingly refreshing) post-apocalyptic tale, and an exorcism thriller. Spiegel & GrauThe WayI\u2019ve always imagined that, if I were to end up a lone human alive in some post-apocalyptic wasteland, I\u2019d eventually befriend other solitary animals of different species and we\u2019d have each others\u2019 backs in the daily fight for survival. Everybody thinks about these things\u2026 right? In any case, that\u2019s kind of the situation Will Collins, the middle-aged protagonist of The Way, finds himself in, in the year 2048, accompanied by a raven named Peau and a cat named Cassie. Much of humankind has been wiped out by waves of disease, but he \u2014 isolated at a Buddhist retreat center \u2014 survived. And he\u2019s one of very few people older than 30 or so to have made it. When Will gets a message from a former mentor asking him to transport a possible cure, he sets out on a road trip through the ruins of the US, facing hostile environmental conditions and hostile humans, but also expanding his odd little family in the process. Will is a narrator that describes things vividly and often philosophically, making for a story that\u2019s both tender and brutal. It pulls you in right away, and the spiritual tone (with a little humor sprinkled in) keeps things from becoming entirely bleak. This is a post-apocalyptic novel that even someone who\u2019s burnt out on post-apocalyptic novels can appreciate. $27 at AmazonBOOM! StudiosWhen I Lay My Vengeance Upon Thee #1Gus Moreno, author of the (very good, must-read) 2021 horror novel This Thing Between Us, has teamed up with artist Jakub Rebelka for a new comic series following an exorcist with unconventional methods and the disgraced priest who has been made his apprentice. In an Instagram post ahead of its release, Moreno said of the series, \u201cIf you ever saw an exorcism movie and thought, this could use more Tarantino references, this is the comic for you.\u201d Yeah, I\u2019m in. The first of its five issues was released this week, diving right in with a murder, an exorcism and a strange hospital visit. It\u2019s mostly setting up the story that has yet to unfold \u2014 cuing us in on Father Manuel Barrera\u2019s downfall and reassignment to Puerto Cristina, the world\u2019s southernmost city, as a trainee under Father Merrick Stygian \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely got me intrigued. I really like the art style, especially how grotesque the characters\u2019 facial features are at times. $5 at Amazon"},{"title":"In 2024, the camera of the year was a drone","text":"Aside from the global shutter on Sony's A9 III and some cool mirrorless options \u2014 the Fujifilm X100 VI, Panasonic S9 and Canon EOS R5 II come to mind \u2014 2024 was a dull year for cameras full of small tweaks and minor improvements. Except for DJI's Neo. For $200, aerial photography is now finally in reach for just about anyone.DJI\u2019s very good, not-so-great yearDJI released its product lineup this year with a sword of Damocles hanging over its head: the US government was planning to ban sales of the company\u2019s products by the end of 2024 over potential fears of spying. It was only at the last minute that DJI gained a reprieve, thanks in large part to lobbying by public safety groups that heavily rely on its drones. It now has until the end of 2025 to prove that its products don\u2019t pose a risk.The company\u2019s list of 2024 camera gear started with the Avata 2, an FPV drone that improved nearly everything from the popular original at a reduced price. DJI then announced it the $299 Mini 4K. We also saw the Action 5 Pro, DJI\u2019s best action cam to date, along with the Air 3S, a highly capable drone with a relatively large 1-inch sensor camera and the Mic Mini, an affordable wireless mic system.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementIts biggest launch, though, was the Neo drone, announced in September. It took the idea of a simple drone for creators, first pioneered (then dropped) by Snap with the Pixy, while lowering the price and adding AI technology. Steve Dent for EngadgetThe Neo is a very lightweight drone that can be piloted without a license and is people-safe thanks to its shrouded propellers. It\u2019s ready to use for beginners straight out of the box without any training \u2014 simply place it in your hand and press a button, then it\u2019ll fly off and capture cool programmed shots like \u201cdronies\u201d.Just because the Neo is approachable doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s basic, though. If you want to pilot the Neo manually, it supports DJI\u2019s controllers, FPV goggles and can even be flown using a smartphone. It can hit speeds up to 18 MPH or even faster in manual mode, and is highly maneuverable. Thanks to the built-in AI features, it can track you while you walk or bike, making it a vlogger\u2019s best friend. Finally, it can capture all your footage at 4K 30p, with surprisingly good quality considering the price point.My main sore point with the Neo is the banshee-like noise it generates, which can be tricky in public places. Overall, though, it's a highly useful product at a great price point and managed to capture the zeitgeist like no other camera product this year.Canon and Fujifilm were the best of the restMy favorite mirrorless camera this year was Canon\u2019s EOS R5 II. That\u2019s not because of any spectacular new tech, but the fact that it\u2019s nearly a perfect hybrid camera. Steve Dent for EngadgetThat starts with the new 45-megapixel stacked sensor that offers a blend of speed and resolution we\u2019ve only ever seen on the Sony\u2019s A1 or the Nikon Z9 \u2014 both considerably more expensive. It also has the company\u2019s most advanced AI autofocus system. All that allows ultra-fast shooting speeds up to 30fps in RAW mode. Its advanced AF system makes blurry photos a rarity even at those speeds. At the same time, the 45-megapixel photos deliver exceptional detail and relatively high dynamic range, with accurate, pleasing colors.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementAt the same time, it offers incredible video powers, with 8K RAW shooting at up to 60fps and 4K 120p. As with photos, video quality is exceptional thanks to the new CLog 2 capture that allows for higher dynamic range. Beyond all that, the EOS R5 II is just a great camera to use, with near-perfect ergonomics.The other camera I really enjoyed using was Fujifilm\u2019s X100 VI compact. The camera deserved the large amount of press it received this year, because its stripped down nature, vintage looks, film simulations and great handling really bring fun back to photography. At the same time, it\u2019s a technological marvel with a higher-resolution 40-megapixel sensor, decently fast shooting speeds, stabilization and solid video specs.Finally, I think Panasonic\u2019s S9 deserves a shoutout for trying something new. It\u2019s one of the smallest full-frame cameras I\u2019ve ever seen, yet offers features like 6K video and in-body stabilization. But the primary new trick is built-in LUT simulations\u2014 kind of like Fujifilm\u2019s X100 VI, but for video. That, combined with the large sensor, makes it an interesting camera.What to expect in the camera world for 2025 Steve Dent for EngadgetDespite a potential US ban, DJI is likely to continue its ambitious product release schedule in 2025. According to rumors, it\u2019s working on a foldable model called the DJI Flip and is also likely to release a successor to the Mavic 3 Pro sometime next year, according to recent FCC filings. Apart from that, it tends to have rapid upgrade cadence for most of its drones and cameras, so expect to see successors for its Action 5 Pro cam, Mini 4 Pro drone and other models.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementElsewhere, one intriguing rumor has Fujifilm releasing a one-inch, half-sensor compact that would be like a digital version of the popular Pentax 17 film camera and may even allow for diptych (side-by-side) photos.Otherwise, Sony is due to release an update for its popular A7 IV launched in 2021 with higher shooting speeds and other specs to better line up with the competition. Canon is very likely to release a new camera in that same price category, the R6 III, also with improved specs. We could see a new Nikon Z5 III model with improved performance. And Panasonic is due to refresh its S1 and S1R models. Manufacturers may jump on the compact train, now that Fujifilm has proved its a viable category \u2014 something that would be good news for all photographers."},{"title":"The 12 best gadgets we reviewed this year","text":"I've lost count of the number of things we reviewed this year at Engadget. In 2024, the types of products we tested ranged from the typical phones, laptops and headphones to AI wearables, robotic lawnmowers and handheld gaming consoles, alongside games and shows. It can feel hard to keep track of it all, but thankfully, our scoring system helps us highlight the best (and the worst) devices each year.Quick OverviewA smaller pro-level Pixel phonePixel 9 ProMore options$999 at Google$999 at Amazon$999 at Best BuyA bigger Pixel, all grown upPixel 9 Pro XLMore options$1,099 at Google$1,099 at Amazon$1,099 at Best BuyDJI Avata 2 $699 at AmazonApple iPhone 16 Pro Max$1,199 at AppleApple iPhone 16 Pro$999 at AppleCanon EOS R5 Mark IIMore options$4,299 at Amazon$4,299 at Macy's$4,299 at Abt ElectronicsSony A9 III$6,000 at B&H Photo VideoDJI Air 3S$1,099 at DJIDJI Neo Drone $199 at AmazonMacBook Pro 14-inch (2024)More options$1,599 at Adorama$1,487 at Abt Electronics$1,599 at AppleMacBook Pro 16-inch (2024)More options$2,249 at Amazon$2,499 at Adorama$2,324 at Abt ElectronicsThe best 14-inch gaming laptop on sale todayASUS ROG Zephyrus G14$2,000 at Best BuySee 7 moreOur team of reviewers and editors evaluate products based on their performance, value and how they hold up against the competition, and at least two people weigh in on every score before it's published. If something gets a result of 80 and up, it's considered a \"Recommended\" product, while those scoring 90 and more are awarded \"Editors' Choice.\" The latter means they're the best in their class, beating out most of the competition.Since we have to be very judicious about what we review (there's only so much time in the world), most of the gadgets we call in are from established companies with a track record of making things people will actually consider buying. That's the main reason most of our scores sit between 80 and 90, though we still test the occasional device that ends up getting a number below 70.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementAs we look back on the year in gadgets, here are the 12 highest-scored reviews we published. Unsurprisingly, they're mostly of Apple and Google products, with a smattering of cameras and drones. I'm also including some honorable mentions for good measure, as well as a pair of the lowest-rated devices all year. May we have only excellent gadgets to review next year, and may there be less e-waste all around.Google94100Expert ScoreA smaller pro-level Pixel phonePixel 9 ProWith a refined design, much-improved telephoto camera and great battery-life, the Pixel 9 Pro cements its status as the smartphone with the best camera.

For the first time in years, we've given a Google phone a higher score than an iPhone in the same year. Maybe it has something to do with Gemini AI launching earlier than Apple Intelligence, or the fun colors and solid build of the Pixel 9 Pro series. But as I discussed the scores with our reviewer Mat Smith, a few things added up. Arguably the biggest advantage Google has over Apple this year is battery life \u2014 the Pixel 9 Pros generally last about two days on a charge, while the iPhone 16 Pro series typically clocks just around 20 hours. We also love Google's cameras and the bright, smooth displays. The gorgeous palette of pastel color options is just icing on a satisfying cake, with Gemini AI bringing a tasty side treat.DJI \/ Engadget94100Expert ScoreDJI Avata 2 The Avata 2 improves just about everything from the very popular original while shaving some dollars off the cost ProsImproved video qualityBetter maneuverabilityCheaperLonger battery lifeConsGoggles 3 may lack comfort for some$699 at AmazonDJI Avata 2Though there is looming concern over DJI's longevity in the US, the company has otherwise had a relatively successful 2024. This year saw many DJI products scoring more than 90 in our database, which makes sense as they are arguably the best drone maker around. Steve was most impressed by the Avata 2, though, thanks to its great video quality and maneuverability for a lower price than its predecessor. It even has better battery life, to boot.Apple \/ Engadget93100Expert ScoreApple iPhone 16 Pro MaxThe iPhone 16 Pro Max offers excellent cameras and editing tools, a large roomy screen, long battery life and the best that Apple has to offer.\u00a0 Editors\u2019 note: The current score reflects our experience with the hardware and iOS 18 features that will be available to users at launch.

Though there's a lot to like about Apple's latest flagships, I was just so disappointed by the relatively poor battery life that I could not score it higher than the Pixel 9 Pro series. This is more noticeable on the iPhone 16 Pro, though, as the Pro Max generally lasts a few more hours than its smaller counterpart. I also wish the generative-AI features were ready for the public at the time of my review, but now that I've spent more time with Genmoji, Image Playground and notification summaries, I'm pretty sure my verdict remains the same. These Apple Intelligence features are fun, but not game-changing, and with or without them the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are still the best options for anyone on iOS.Canon93100Expert ScoreCanon EOS R5 Mark IIThe EOS R5 II is Canon\u2019s best camera in years thanks to improvements in key areas like autofocus and video.

As a Canon girl myself, I was happy to see the EOS R5 II get such a good rating, especially since competition has been heating up. Sadly, the EOS R5 II also heats up when shooting high-res video, but on pretty much every other aspect, it performs respectably. According to Steve, this camera \"puts Sony on notice,\" and I'm glad to see it.Sony92100Expert ScoreSony A9 IIISony\u2019s A9 III is the first mainstream camera with an innovative global shutter, which is fast with minimal image distortion. But it results in reduced image quality compared to regular CMOS cameras. ProsIncredibly quickFast and accurate autofocusGood stabilizationExcellent video capaibilitiesConsReduced image qualityExpensive$6,000 at B&H Photo VideoSony A9 IIIReviewed much earlier in the year, the Sony A9 III caught Steve's attention for its speedy global shutter, which brought fast and accurate autofocus. It also delivered smooth, high-quality video in a body with excellent handling thanks to Sony's comfortable new grip. Steve also loved the viewfinder, and though it's very expensive at $6,000, the A9 III is a solid product that holds the title of \"fastest full-frame camera\" \u2014 at least, until something faster comes along.DJI92100Expert ScoreDJI Air 3SDJI\u2019s Air 3S is the company\u2019s first consumer drone with LiDAR designed to make it safer to fly at night.\u00a0 ProsExcellent image qualityLiDAR improves obstacle detection at nightActiveTrack 360 produces cinematic tracking shotsLong battery lifeNow has 42GB internal storageConsSometimes fails to detect small obstacles$1,099 at DJIDJI92100Expert ScoreDJI Neo Drone The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots.

That would be the DJI Neo, which, despite Steve's evocative description, is something I'm considering buying for myself. Not only is it reasonably priced, but it also promises to capture smooth aerial footage at a respectable resolution. Steve also found it beginner-friendly, which is important for a lousy pilot like me. And sure, maybe I'll scare some wildlife or neighbors with its loud screeching, but maybe that's part of the fun?ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementIf you want something that can avoid people or obstacles and deliver cinematic shots, the DJI Air 3S is a solid option thanks to its LiDAR and larger camera sensor, both of which improve performance and obstacle-detection in low light. You'll have to pay about five times the Neo's cost, of course, but aspiring Spielbergs might find that price worthwhile.Apple92100Expert ScoreMacBook Pro 14-inch (2024)Apple\u2019s 14-inch MacBook Pro is better than ever thanks to its M4 chips, Thunderbolt 5 support and slightly brighter screens.

Apple has demonstrated over the last few years that its M-series processors deliver excellent performance and battery life, and it's continued to prove its point in 2024. This year's model features brighter screens and improved webcams, as well as slight bumps in RAM and storage. I'm a Windows user, but even I have to admit that what Apple is doing with the MacBooks is something that Microsoft and all its partners on the PC side have struggled to fully replicate.ASUS \/ Engadget91100Expert ScoreThe best 14-inch gaming laptop on sale todayASUS ROG Zephyrus G14For anyone who wants strong performance in a portable design, the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 is both pound for pound and dollar for dollar the best choice around. ProsBeautiful understated designGorgeous OLED screenStrong performanceGood port selectionPunchy speakersConsBottom vents can get a bit toastyKeyboard only has single-zone lightingArmoury Crate app is kind of messyRAM is soldered in$2,000 at Best BuyASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2024)What PC makers do excel at is power and creativity. When it's not experimenting with dual-screen laptops, ASUS is pushing out capable gaming laptops in its Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand. This year, our reviewer Sam Rutherford's top-scored product is the ROG Zephyrus G14, which he declared \"the 14-inch gaming laptop to beat.\" Sam hasn't given out a higher score at all this year, so it stands to reason we have yet to see a gaming notebook steal that crown. The Zephyrus G14 won Sam over with its beautiful OLED screen, attractive yet subtle design and generous array of ports. Though he's not a fan of its soldered-in RAM and ASUS' Armoury Crate app, Sam still found plenty to like, calling it \"both pound for pound and dollar for dollar the best choice around.\"Honorable mention: reMarkable Paper ProThere are plenty of products that might have received the same score as the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 and iPhone 16 Pro, but we have to cut the list somewhere. It's worth mentioning that other devices we awarded a score of 91 include the DJI Osmo Pocket 3, the Analogue Duo, the Fujifilm X100 VI and the iPad Air (2024). And when it comes to things that got 90 points, we've got the base iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, the Apple Watch Series 10, NVIDIA's RTX 4070 Super graphics card, the Meta Quest 3S headset, as well as appliances like Ninja's Creami ice-cream maker.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementBut I wanted to shout out Daniel Cooper's review of the reMarkable Paper Pro. It's a gadget that's brought back waves of nostalgia and sentimentality in a time when we're all tired of constantly being wired in. It's one of the highest-rated products of its kind, not only because it's a capable writing tablet, but also because it is a color e-paper tablet that has a bigger screen and faster performance than its monochrome predecessor. At $580 to start, it's certainly a significant investment, but one that might free us from feeling chained to our laptops and phones.Worst products we reviewed this year: Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1In all my 8-plus years at Engadget, I can only remember one other time we've awarded anything a sub-60 score, and that was when Fisher-Price's Sproutling wearable baby monitor gave our editor's baby an eczema outbreak. The Sproutling got an appropriately all-time low score of 41, and this year, the Rabbit R1 broke that bottom when Devindra decided it deserved only 40 points.The Rabbit R1 first made waves at CES 2024, when it showed up out of nowhere and enticed many of us with its cute looks and bright orange color. Its Teenage Engineering heritage was even more alluring, and we all wanted to try out the Playdate-esque scroll wheel for ourselves. The square device also came with an onboard camera, two microphones, rotating camera and a 2.88-inch display. But its biggest promise was, as with everything in 2024, all about AI.And with many things in 2024, the AI promise fell flat. Rabbit made bold claims about its \"large action model,\" but in actuality, at the time of our review, the R1 could barely execute tasks to completion. Instead of letting you easily make orders via DoorDash, for example, it would \"often deliver the weather when I asked for traffic,\" according to Devindra's review. Worse, \"sometimes it would hear my request and simply do nothing.\" Photo by Cherlynn Low \/ EngadgetI had a similarly frustrating experience when testing the much-hyped Humane AI Pin. It was a shiny chrome square that you could attach to your clothes and interact with either by voice, touch or via a futuristic-looking projector that beamed a display onto your palm. You were supposed to be able to simply talk to the Humane AI assistant to get it to remember things for and about you, eventually coming to rely on it like a second brain.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementInstead, we got a hot mess. Quite literally. The Humane AI Pin would frequently run so hot that it would stop working, with the device saying it needed to cool down for a bit before you could use it again. When it did work, it was barely smart enough to answer questions, and though the projector was cool visually, using it to do anything was frustrating and just led to sore arms and crossed eyes. Not only did it not do enough to justify the effort involved in using it, the Humane AI Pin also cost $700 \u2014 way too much for a product this finicky.It gets worse (or better, depending on how you're reading this). Shortly after it was widely criticized by reviewers in April, leaked internal documents showed that people appeared to be returning the AI Pins faster than the company was selling them. In October, Humane had to issue a recall for its charging case due to overheating, with the Consumer Product Safety Commission saying it posed \"a fire hazard.\"I gave the Humane AI Pin a score of 50 in my review, in large part due to the intriguing projector display. Right now, though, it seems these AI gadgets are, at best, struggling to take hold. At worst, they're on fire."},{"title":"In 2024, using social media felt worse than ever","text":"It\u2019s never been more exhausting to be online than in 2024. While it\u2019s been clear for some time that monetization has shifted social media into a different beast, this year in particular felt like a tipping point. Faced with the endless streams of content that\u2019s formulated to trap viewers\u2019 gazes, shoppable ads at every turn, AI and the unrelenting opinions of strangers, it struck me recently that despite my habitual use of these apps, I\u2019m not actually having fun on any of them anymore.Take Instagram. I open the app and I\u2019m greeted by an ad for bidets. I start scrolling. Between each of the first three posts at the top of my feed is a different ad: lingerie, squat-friendly jorts, shoes from a brand selling items that appear to be dropshipped from AliExpress at a markup. Then, thankfully, two memes back to back. I fire off the funny one to five of my friends in a way that feels obligatory. After that, another ad, then a bunch of seemingly off-target Reels from accounts I don\u2019t even follow. Minutes pass before I encounter a post by someone I know in real life. Oh yeah, it\u2019s time to turn off suggested posts again, something I have to do every 30 days or my feed will be filled with random crap.But before I get a chance to do that, I\u2019m distracted by a Reel of a cat watching The Grinch. Then by a Reel of a guy with a tiny chihuahua in his coat pocket. Curiosity gets the better of me and I open the comments, where people are angrily writing that the dog must be suffocating. Oh no. I scroll to the next Reel, a video I\u2019ve seen several times before of a rooster marching around in a pair of pants. Below, everyone\u2019s fighting about whether it\u2019s cruel to put pants on a chicken. Is it? Next, a video of a girl doing her makeup, where men are commenting that this should be considered catfishing. Deep sigh. I realize 30 minutes have somehow passed and I close Instagram, now in a worse mood than when I opened it. I\u2019ll compulsively return in an hour or so, rinse and repeat.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementIt\u2019s not just an Instagram problem. On TikTok (which may or may not get shut down in the US very soon), the For You page has me figured out pretty well contentwise and the presence of toxic commenters is minimal, but every other post is either sponsored or hawking a product from the TikTok Shop. And it\u2019s too easy to get sucked into the perpetual scroll. I often avoid opening the app at all just because I know I\u2019ll end up getting trapped there for longer than I want to, watching videos about nothing made by people I don\u2019t know and never will. But it still happens more frequently than I\u2019d like to admit.These days, it feels like every gathering place on the internet is so crowded with content that\u2019s competing for \u2014 and successfully grabbing \u2014 our attention or trying to sell us something that there\u2019s barely any room for the \u201csocial\u201d element of social media. Instead, we\u2019re pushed into separate corners to stare at the glowing boxes in our hands alone.Fittingly, Oxford announced at the end of November that its Word of the Year for 2024 is \u201cbrain rot,\u201d a term that expresses the supposed consequence of countless hours spent on the internet consuming stupid stuff. Just as fitting, Australia\u2019s Macquarie Dictionary chose \u201censhittification,\u201d which describes how the platforms and products we love get ruined over time as the companies behind them chase profits. (It was also The American Dialect Society\u2019s 2023 Word of the Year). Social media platforms were in theory designed around ideas of friendship and connection, but what\u2019s playing out on them today couldn\u2019t feel further from genuine human interaction.Facebook \u2014 if you even have an account still \u2014 might be where you\u2019d go if you really wanted to see updates from family and other people you know IRL, but its UI has become so cluttered with recommended Reels and products that it feels unusable. Twitter, where it was once fun to keep up with live discourse around major events or fandom happenings, no longer exists, and X, its new form under Elon Musk, is filled with bots and political propaganda.On the other hand, Threads, an offshoot of Instagram and Meta\u2019s answer to Twitter\/X, took off this year and it quickly became a hotspot for copy-paste engagement bait, a problem so bad that Adam Mosseri has publicly acknowledged it. The Threads team has apparently been \u201cworking to get it under control,\u201d but I still can\u2019t scroll through my For You feed without seeing a dozen posts that are either just regurgitated memes being passed off as original thoughts, or questions to the masses that are crafted with the intention of stirring the pot. The same feed is otherwise dominated by viral videos that are ripped off from other creators without credit and pop culture commentary that almost always devolves into sex- and genderism. I often step away from Threads feeling the need to go scream in a field.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThreads doesn\u2019t have DMs, meaning all conversations take place in public. It finally gave users the ability to create custom feeds around searchable topics in November, but those topic pages are generally still riddled with bait-style posts, just more subject-specific versions. That\u2019s meant so far that it\u2019s been pretty hard to find communities to authentically connect with. It all feels so impersonal.It doesn\u2019t help that Threads\u2019 Following feed currently isn\u2019t the default view and there\u2019s no way to change that (though Threads recently began testing the option). And at the end of the day, its 275 million or so monthly active users doesn\u2019t include all that many people I actually know, especially outside of the media industry. The same goes for fediverse social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky, which are far less populated but have a cliquier feel. Visiting those platforms feels like walking into a room full of people who all know each other really well, and realizing you\u2019re the odd one out. But at least Bluesky nor Mastodon aren\u2019t poorly veiled shopping experiences. (Threads isn\u2019t at the moment, either, but ads are reportedly coming).Maybe it all comes down to burnout in the era of excessive consumption, but lately I\u2019ve found myself wishing for a place on the internet that feels both inviting and human. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen alternative social apps pop up like BeReal, Hive and the Myspace-reminiscent entrants SpaceHey and noplace, all aiming to bring character and interpersonal connection back into social media. But none have quite cracked the code for lasting mainstream adoption. Discord and even Reddit to some extent address the same person-to-person need, yet they share more in common with proto social media chatrooms and forums than with the sites that sprung up during the social heyday.Meanwhile, Meta is increasingly pushing AI across its apps. Just this summer we got the chatbot-maker, AI Studio, which Meta touted not only as a way for users to create AI characters, but for \u201ccreators to build an AI as an extension of themselves to reach more fans.\u201d Rather than talk to your real friends or make new ones around a common interest, you can deepen your parasocial relationship with celebrities, influencers and fictional characters by chatting with the AI versions of them. Or, pick from several AI girlfriends you can now find in the menu of your DMs. We\u2019ve completely lost the plot, I fear.I\u2019ve started dipping back into Tumblr here and there, if only to see a less chaotic, more curated feed and relish in the reminder of how fun customization can be. A few friends have mentioned that they\u2019ve been doing the same. But given the platform\u2019s past policy upheavals and its current AI partnerships, it\u2019s not exactly an online oasis either. As if on cue, I was recently served a mock Tumblr poster during my evening scroll that felt uncannily apt: \u201cwe didn\u2019t get better. the rest of the internet just got worse.\u201d"},{"title":"United will start testing Starlink on flights in February","text":"United Airlines has announced plans to start testing Starlink on flights in February, and eventually add SpaceX's satellite internet service to its entire fleet.

In the piece, the company has revealed that it's spending a total of $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers in 2025. Microsoft said it's building out the data centers to be able to train and deploy AI models, as well as to power its cloud-based applications. While that's the entirety of its budget for projects around the world, more than half of it will go towards building data centers in the United States.The company explained that none of the progress on AI the industry has achieved thus far would be possible \"without new partnerships founded on large-scale infrastructure investments.\" It's now calling for the incoming Trump administration to expand the government's support for the advancement of AI within the US, such as providing the National Science Foundation and US universities more funding for research.Microsoft admitted in the piece that it knows AI will \"disrupt the economy and displace some jobs,\" but it also said its \"confidence has grown that AI will create new opportunities that will outweigh many of the challenges ahead.\" The key, Microsoft explained, is to train Americans so that they'd be able to use AI as a tool for their jobs, similar to how they're currently using smartphones and laptops. Finally, it said that the third critical priority for 2025 is the promotion of American AI exports. There will be a race between the United States and China to spread their technologies to other countries, so the US needs a smart strategy because the race \"will be won by the fastest first mover.\"If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."},{"title":"Utah lawsuit alleges TikTok knew minors were being exploited on livestreams","text":"Streams on TikTok Live were used to exploit children, according to a newly unredacted lawsuit filed by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes. The lawsuit says that TikTok was not only aware that TikTok Lives were exposing minors to concerning messages from adults, but the company also directly profited off of some of the exchanges through TikTok Live's virtual gifting system.Following an investigation by Forbes\u00a0into TikTok Live, TikTok conducted its own review called \"Project Meramec,\" according to the suit. The company found that \"hundreds of thousands of children\" were getting around TikTok's age restrictions, hosting livestreams and interacting with adults.Because TikTok pockets a portion of the sale of digital gifts in livestreams, the company was technically making money on \"transactional gifting\" over \"nudity and sexual activity\" that happened during streams. And since TikTok's algorithm favors livestreams where virtual gifts are being exchanged, the lawsuit says, some of these sexually exploitative streams were also distributed more widely than they would have been otherwise.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe lawsuit details another TikTok investigation, \"Project Jupiter,\" that looked in to whether TikTok Live's gifting feature was being used to launder money. As it turns out, it was. According to the lawsuit, the company found that \"criminals were selling drugs and running fraud operations\" during livestreams.When reached for a comment on the lawsuit, TikTok shared the following statement:This lawsuit ignores the number of proactive measures that TikTok has voluntarily implemented to support community safety and well-being. Instead, the complaint cherry-picks misleading quotes and outdated documents and presents them out of context, which distorts our commitment to the safety of our community.We stand by our efforts, which include: robust safety protections and screen time limits for teen accounts enabled by default, Family Pairing tools for parents to supervise their teens, strict livestreaming requirements, and aggressive enforcement of our Community Guidelines on an ongoing basis.Utah's AG filed the redacted version of this lawsuit in June 2024, following a different suit from 2023 concerning the addictive design of the TikTok app. The Utah lawsuit isn't the first time the company has come under scrutiny for its handling of child safety. The FTC has investigated TikTok's handling of child privacy, and the ban of the app \u2014 now headed to the Supreme Court on appeal \u2014 was partially pushed over concerns with how social video app could be used to influence children."},{"title":"Sony CES 2025 press conference: Watch it here Monday at 8pm ET","text":"SonyBe it for the Walkman portables and Trinitron TVs of old or the PlayStation consoles, Alpha cameras and superlative headphones of the twenty-first century, Sony has long been a mainstay at CES.

The Afeela electric vehicle dominated Sony's 2023 and 2024 CES press conferences, and we know that trend will continue for 2025, with an appearance at the Sony event (and a followup press conference) already confirmed.What to expect at Sony's CES 2025 press conferenceThe Afeela is the first product from Sony Honda Mobility, a joint venture between the Japanese electronics and transportation giants. After a surprise rollout at CES 2023, the Sony CES presser teed up additional details on the EV's LiDAR-heavy sensor array and AI-enhanced cabin tech (the latter coming with an assist from Microsoft) at CES 2024.

Meta doesn\u2019t seem to have updated any of these profiles for several months, and the pages seem to have been largely unnoticed until this week, following an interview published by the Financial Times with Meta\u2019s VP of Generative AI, Connor Hayes.In the interview, Hayes spoke about the company\u2019s goal to eventually fill its services with AI-generated profiles that can interact with people and function \u201ckind of in the same way that accounts do.\u201d Those comments brought attention to the extant fMeta-created AI profiles and, well, users were not exactly impressed with what they found.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementWith handles like \u201chellograndpabrian,\u201d a supposed \u201cretired textile businessman who is always learning\u201d and \u201cdatingwithCarter,\u201d an AI \u201cdating coach,\u201d the chatbots were meant to showcase \u201cunique interests and personalities\u201d for users to chat with. On Instagram, their profiles also featured AI-generated posts that, as 404 Media noted, looked a lot like the AI spam that\u2019s become prevalent in many corners of Facebook. MetaAn AI persona called \u201cLiv\u201d sparked particular outrage. The Instagram profile identified \u201cLiv\u201d as a \u201cproud Black queer momma of 2 & truth-teller.\u201d Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah posted a series of screenshots in which she interrogated \u201cLiv\u201d about how Meta trained the AI, with \u201cLiv\u201d sharing that it was created by a \u201cpredominantly white team.\u201d Independent journalist Mady Castigan posted another conversation in which \u201cLiv\u201d said that its creators had been inspired in part by Sophia Vergara\u2019s character from Modern Family, a character that is neither queer nor Black.\u201cThere is confusion: the recent Financial Times article was about our vision for AI characters existing on our platforms over time, not announcing any new product,\u201d a spokesperson told Engadget. \u201cThe accounts referenced are from a test we launched at Connect in 2023. These were managed by humans and were part of an early experiment we did with AI characters.\"Beyond sparking ridicule for their responses and attempts to appropriate marginalized identities, users found the AI profiles were impossible to block, for reasons unknown. Rather than fix the issue, Meta's solution was to kill the experiment entirely. \"We identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs,\" a spokesperson said, \"and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.\u201dADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementWhile this trial run has gone up in flames, the company doesn\u2019t seem to be abandoning its plans to bring more AI-generated \u201ccharacters\u201d to its apps. Earlier this year, the company teased AI clones of human creators capable of holding lifelike video calls. Creators can already train their own chatbots to respond to followers on their behalf. Meta also began experimenting with inserting its own AI-generated imagery into users\u2019 Facebook feeds.In an interview last year, Hayes told me that Meta likely will become more \u201cproactive\u201d about surfacing AI-generated content over time, comparing it to the shift from showing recommended content instead of posts from people you follow.\u201cIn the beginning of social apps \u2026 the corpus of stuff that you could see on a given day was sort of constrained by who you followed or were friends with. And over the last like, five or six years, a lot of apps \u2014 ourselves included \u2014 have moved to, you know, relax that constraint and start recommending content from accounts you don't follow.\u201cI think probably the next leap that's going to happen there is relaxing the constraint of what humans can create, and actually getting to feeds of content that are a combination of things that, you know, humans have created, but also that are entirely machine generated.\u201dIt may still be awhile before Meta fully realizes that vision. But if the reaction to its early experimentations is any indication, the company still has a lot of work to do to convince people AI personas are worth interacting with in the first place."},{"title":"CES 2025: The new tech we're expecting to see from Samsung, NVIDIA, LG and more in Las Vegas","text":"Time to get into the habit of writing \"2025\" instead of 2024, and the year may have just begun, but the Engadget team is already working hard for CES 2025. This weekend, many from the Engadget team will be flying to Las Vegas, where we\u2019ll be covering tech\u2019s biggest annual conference. We've scoured our bursting inboxes, full of pitches from companies that are planning to be there, and meticulously filled out copious spreadsheets with upcoming launches and appointments for briefings and demos.Based on our experience, as well as observation of recent industry trends, it\u2019s fairly easy to make educated predictions about what we might see in a few days. Over the years, the focus of the conference has spanned areas like TVs, cars, smart home products and personal health, with a smattering of laptops and accessories thrown in. At CES 2025, we expect to see AI get even more pervasive in all areas of the show floor. But we are also likely to get the usual slew of new processors and subsequent laptops, as well as all manner of wearables, trackers, bathroom appliances and massage chairs. Oh, the massage chairs.What we already know is comingThere's already a lot we know is coming, just by a cursory glance at the lineup published by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA). In addition to numerous panels and talks, there will be keynotes by NVIDIA's founder and CEO Jensen Huang, Delta CEO Ed Bastian as well as C-suite executives from companies like Panasonic, SiriusXM, Waymo and Volvo group. We've also seen that Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X (Twitter), will be interviewed by journalist Catherine Herridge at a keynote on January 7, while Snap CEO Evan Spiegel will be speaking about the \"future goals of the platform\" on January 8.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSome companies didn't even wait till January to make their news known. LG, for example, continues its annual tradition of sharing its upcoming CES launches weeks ahead of the show by unveiling the 2025 refresh for its QNED evo line of LCD TVs. The company has continued to release more information, including announcing its 45-inch UltraGear bendable OLED gaming monitor alongside a line of curved OLED screens.In fact, here's a little list of all the other CES 2025 things LG has already shared so far:LG\u2019s new projector looks like a stand fanLG updates its Gram laptop line ahead of CES 2025LG slapped a 27-inch touchscreen on its latest microwaveHyundai Mobis, meanwhile, has said it will be giving us a look at its \"Holographic Windshield Display,\" something it's claiming is a world's first. Hyundai Mobis even shared a picture of what its booth at CES 2025 will look like, in case pictures of convention center booths get you excited. Hyundai MobisIf you\u2019re already looking ahead to 2025 and are studiously researching what might be coming in January, here\u2019s a taste of what our team expects to see at the show.New video cards from AMD and NVIDIAThere\u2019s no doubt 2025 is going to be a momentous year for PC gamers. NVIDIA is expected to debut its long-awaited RTX 5000 video cards at CES, while AMD CEO Lisa Su has confirmed we\u2019ll see next-generation RDNA 4 GPUs early next year. Of the two companies, AMD could use the upgrade more. Its last batch of Radeon 7000 cards were decent mid-range performers, but they lagged far behind NVIDIA\u2019s hardware when it came to ray tracing, and AMD\u2019s FSR 3 upscaling also couldn\u2019t compete with NVIDIA\u2019s AI-powered DLSS 3.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisement\"In addition to a strong increase in gaming performance, RDNA 4 delivers significantly higher ray-tracing performance and adds new AI capabilities,\u201d AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an October earnings call.As for NVIDIA\u2019s new hardware, a rumor from the leaker OneRaichu (via DigitalTrends) suggested that the RTX 5090 could be up to 70 percent faster than the RTX 4090. (That\u2019s a GPU that I previously described as having \u201cunholy power.\u201d) They also note that other \u201chigh level\u201d cards could see 30 to 40 percent performance bumps. Those gains might be enough to tempt wealthy RTX 4090 owners to upgrade, but RTX 4070 and 4080 owners might want to skip this generation. For NVIDIA holdouts with RTX 3000 and earlier GPUs, though, next year may be the perfect time to upgrade. \u2014 Devindra Hardawar, senior reporterAI PCs round 2Last year, I predicted that AI PCs would dominate CES, and that mostly turned out to be true. As 2024 rolled on, we saw even more powerful NPUs in chips from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm. Microsoft also doubled down on AI PCs with its Copilot+ initiative, which gave a big marketing push for artificial intelligence features and premium specifications (like having at least 16GB of RAM).Expect more of the same going into CES 2025, alongside even more AI being stuffed into every category of product imaginable. This year, in particular, PC makers are likely to gear up to take advantage of Windows 10 support ending next year. Instead of just upgrading your old computer to Windows 11, the likes of Dell and HP would rather you buy a whole new AI PC with the new OS pre-installed.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementWhile 2024 was a year of endless AI PC hype, 2025 might end up being a year of reckoning. Microsoft\u2019s long-delayed Recall feature is slowly trickling out to more users, but it\u2019s already showing some glaring security holes, like failing to scrub social security and credit card numbers from screenshots. We\u2019ve also been mostly underwhelmed with Apple Intelligence\u2019s image generation capabilities. PC makers have been eager to talk up the potential of AI-powered features until now, but in 2025 they\u2019ll have to actually prove they can live up to their fantastical claims. \u2014 D.H.Earbuds that follow Apple\u2019s lead on hearing healthI\u2019m fully aware not every audio company has the ability to build out a clinical-grade hearing test and hearing aid features in their apps. However, Apple\u2019s recent update for the AirPods Pro 2 should inspire the competition to offer some form of hearing health tools on their flagship products. Jabra was probably the best equipped to do this since parent company GN has extensive hearing aid experience. Sadly, the company announced earlier this year that it wouldn\u2019t make earbuds anymore.Samsung and Google could probably integrate something like what Apple made for the AirPods, given both companies\u2019 existing health platforms. If they did, those announcements are unlikely to be made at CES, as both companies prefer to host their own standalone hardware events throughout the year.That leaves Sennheiser as the biggest audio company that consistently launches earbuds and headphones at CES. Last year, it showcased multiple new models, including one with heart-rate tracking for workouts. Plus, it already offers hearing assistance with dedicated devices like the true wireless Conversation Clear Plus. Those earbuds are more hearing focused than for general content consumption, so it would be great to see Sennheiser bring some features from that product to its flagship Momentum line of earbuds. Perhaps a Momentum True Wireless 4 Pro or Plus is in the cards, but the current model is just nine months old.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementOf course, there\u2019s plenty of room for other companies to innovate here, and there will be no shortage of new earbuds in Vegas next month. We also tend to see a ton of assistive devices and technology launch at CES, from major accessibility companies like OrCam and all manner of smaller brands. I just hope some of the new tech includes more general hearing tools on the models most people will want to use. \u2014 Billy Steele, senior editorVehicle electrification goes sky highAs the growth of electric cars nears 10 percent of new models sold in the US, it\u2019s easy to forget that wheeled vehicles aren\u2019t the only kind of transportation seeing the shift to battery-powered propulsion. Flying taxis have been a mainstay of CES for the past few years, with concept vehicles from brands as large as Hyundai dotting the show floor in Vegas.Granted, these contraptions look more like giant drones with cockpits than anything the Jetsons ever dreamed up. But with companies like Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation pledging to actually launch eVTOL services (electric vertical take-off and landing) in 2025, the era of air taxis may have landed for real this time. \u2014 Sam Rutherford, senior reporterTurning more phones into satellite phonesSince Apple introduced Emergency SOS via Satellite on the iPhone 14 in 2022, we've seen a serious uptick in development in satellite communications. Not only did Apple expand its feature to allow for non-emergency communications, component makers like Qualcomm, too, tried to bring similar capabilities to Android devices. Snapdragon Satellite was announced at CES 2023, as a project between Qualcomm and Iridium, but the initiative did not gain popularity with smartphone companies, and was ultimately ended in November that same year.Since then, Google launched satellite calling in Pixel 9 phones, while SpaceX's Starlink satellite texting service has gone live in New Zealand via telco One NZ. In the US, T-Mobile opened up beta signups for its Starlink-powered satellite cell service this year. The skies are getting more crowded, too, with AT&T and partner AST SpaceMobile launching five satellites in September, as well as Amazon's Project Kuiper looking to boost its satellite internet network with space lasers.This year, Garmin launched the inReach Messenger Plus, which it describes as an \"SOS Satellite Communicator with Photo and Voice messaging.\" Though satellite hotspots like that have been around for years from companies like Iridium and GlobalSat, they've historically cost $800 to $1,000, and haven't had the ability to send much more than a few lines of text. Garmin's product may be an indicator of things to come \u2014 not only are we likely to see major phone makers embed satellite communication capability into future handsets, but in the interim we're probably going to get a bunch of hotspots so we'll never lose connectivity, not matter how far off the grid we get. And I wouldn't be surprised if CES 2025 is rife with devices that let us tap into satellites to get help and talk to others. \u2014 Cherlynn Low, deputy editorExpanded dialog improvement features on soundbarsWhen it comes to the main aspects of soundbars, there really isn\u2019t a ton of innovation from year to year. Heck, Samsung\u2019s biggest update last year was the addition of HDMI 2.1 support to its flagship model, which should\u2019ve been there already. Companies have also been focused on the transition to cable-free everything, whether that\u2019s wireless Dolby Atmos or wireless transmission boxes. Audio enhancement features are a place where companies can really rise above the fray, and tools like Sonos\u2019 TV Audio Swap and Bose\u2019s Personal Surround Sound are great examples of this. A key area nearly every company can improve is dialog boost, a feature that raises the volume or separates spoken word from background noise and music for better clarity.Sonos made a huge leap in this regard on the Arc Ultra, offering two additional settings for its so-called Speech Enhancement. Previously, this was just an all-or-nothing toggle, which is how most companies handle their versions of this tool. Not only is the Sonos update customizable to a degree, it\u2019s also just better, thanks in part to the redesigned architecture of its new premium soundbar. This is an obvious area where other companies can improve.LG and Samsung typically announce new soundbars at CES, and there are plenty of smaller companies that will debut some too. I\u2019d love to see all of them take dialog enhancements a step further and at the very least give multiple options for how it\u2019s applied. LG has been using AI Sound Pro from its TVs since 2021 and Samsung offers something called Adaptive Sound on its home theater speakers. I would expect them both to generally improve the quality of their features, but I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll expand the capabilities too. \u2014 B.S.Update, December 17 2024, 12:40PM ET: This story has been updated to include the companies and CEOs that will be making keynotes at the show.Update, December 20 2024, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Hyundai Mobis' announcements ahead of CES 2025.Update, December 25 2024, 10:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include a prediction about satellite communication devices being everywhere at CES 2025.Update, December 30 2024, 12:00PM ET: This story has been updated to include a section titled \"What we already know is coming,\" that contains newer information about appearances by X CEO Linda Yaccarino and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, as well as updates on LG's UltraGear line.

In October 2023, a group of music publishers, including Universal Music and ABKCO, filed a copyright infringement complaint against Anthropic. The group alleged that the company had trained its Claude AI model on at least 500 songs to which they held rights and that, when promoted, Claude could reproduce the lyrics of those tracks either partially or in full. Among the song lyrics the publishers said Anthropic had infringed on included Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cHalo\u201d and \u201cMoves Like Jagger\u201d by Maroon 5.In a court-approved stipulation the two sides came to on Thursday, Anthropic agreed to maintain its existing guardrails against outputs that reproduce, distribute or display copyright material owned by the publishers and implement those same measures when training its future AI models.At the same time, the company said it would respond \u201cexpeditiously\u201d to any copyright concerns from the group and promised to provide written responses detailing how and when it plans to address their concerns. In cases where the company intends not to address an issue, it must clearly state its intent to do so.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisement\u201cClaude isn\u2019t designed to be used for copyright infringement, and we have numerous processes in place designed to prevent such infringement,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told Engadget. \"Our decision to enter into this stipulation is consistent with those priorities. We continue to look forward to showing that, consistent with existing copyright law, using potentially copyrighted material in the training of generative AI models is a quintessential fair use.\"As mentioned, Thursday\u2019s pact doesn\u2019t fully resolve the original disagreement between Anthropic and the group of music publishers that sued the company. The latter party is still seeking an injunction against Anthropic to prevent it from using unauthorized copies of song lyrics to train future AI models.

The PF600U may look like a stand fan, but it's actually a projector that's also a Bluetooth speaker and a LED mood lamp. Its lighting has nine colors and five brightness levels, so you can customize it to create the ambiance you want. Tilt its head, and you've got yourself a projector that can produce images up to 120 inches in size with an FHD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution and 300 ANSI lumens of brightness. It can stream movies, shows and other content from streaming platforms via LG's webOS.The company's other projector is CineBeam Q's direct successor. CineBeam S is now LG's smallest 4K Ultra Short Throw projector and weighs in at only 5.5 pounds. It's capable of delivering images as big as 100 inches \u2014 with a 4K UHD resolution and with 500 ANSI lumens of brightness \u2014 while only needing \"a few inches of wall clearance.\" It has Dolby Atmos capability, and like the PF600U, it's powered by LG's webOS.

I don't mean to be a downer, but it's cold all of the time, dark most of the time and this lasts far beyond the most wonderful time of the year. Here at Engadget, we've tried so many tools and products to make winter more bearable from therapy lamps to heaters. We've invested in tea sets, wrapped ourselves in heated blankets and learned to grow herbs indoors \u2014 really, anything that will make these three-plus months more bearable, we've tried.Here, you'll find some of the best winter tech getting us at Engadget through the coldest months as warm, comfortable and content as possible, from wool socks to humidifiers to hydroponic home gardens and everything in between.Quick OverviewBombas Men's Merino Wool Blend Calf Sock 4-Pack$88 at BombasLevoit Top Fill Humidifier 2.5L$30 at AmazonDyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus fan heater AM09$470 at DysonNekteck Shiatsu Foot Massager Machine with Soothing Heat$70 at AmazonHatch Restore 2More options$170 at Amazon$170 at TargetVertefarm Hydroponic Home Garden$799 at Vertefarm See 1 moreBombasBombas Men's Merino Wool Blend Calf Sock 4-PackDespite climate change, it can still be quite frigid in the northeast US. Times like these are much easier to tolerate with a good pair of socks, and fortunately I found my absolute favorites a few years ago. The Bombas Merino Wool Blend Calf Sock (though you can get any length you please) manages to be extremely warm without being overly thick and bulky, so shoes still fit as you'd expect. They're not cheap, but there's definitely something to be said for finding a go-to sock for the winter. I don't wear them every day, but whenever temperatures dip below freezing, I pull them out. I'm even excited to get some as a holiday gift, which the kid version of me would be ashamed of. But hey, maybe if I had socks this nice when I was 10, I would have been more excited by them at Christmas. \u2014 Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor $88 at BombasLevoitLevoit Top Fill Humidifier 2.5LWinter really brings out all the classic, nerdy vibes in me. There's the fact that I am always bundled in a heated blanket reading with my big glasses. There's the need to ensure I always take my inhaler and nasal spray to combat the cold, dry air. Then, there's my trusty companion, the 2.5L Levoit Top Fill humidifier.\u00a0 My home is always dry and it gets painfully worse anytime the heat goes on (shocking, right?) I typically fill up my Levoit humidifier most of the way before I get into bed and then leave it on overnight. A dial allows me to control how intense the cool mist is that comes out \u2014 I typically go for just under half power and position it a couple feet away from me. It has an auto shut-off function, but it can run up to 25 hours so it's normally still on when I wake up. I also like that this humidifier has no disruptive light and is quiet. Though, it's worth saying that I like white noise, while my partner finds its noise a bit disruptive.\u00a0 There are two really annoying things about humidifiers: putting them together after filling, and cleaning them. This humidifier's design improves both of these things. For starters, the top-fill mechanism means I don't have to flip the whole thing over onto the stand just right in order to use it. I can just hold the container upright and guide it into place. Cleaning is always going to be slightly frustrating, especially since you have to do it after almost every use. But, I've found this model's open design makes it a bit easier and the small brush included means I don't need to waste cotton buds to reach its little nooks. \u2014 Sarah Fielding, Contributing Reporter $30 at AmazonDyson Dyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus fan heater AM09Every home I\u2019ve lived in as an adult gets chilly in the winter, and while I default to living underneath piles of blankets, I still wouldn\u2019t be able to get through a snowy season without my trusty Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool fan. I\u2019ve had this thing for over five years at this point and I think it\u2019s been in Dyson\u2019s lineup for even longer than that \u2014 and for good reason. It\u2019s an excellent heater in the winter, and it works as a basic fan in the warmer months. It has a few different levels of heat strength, and the Diffused and Jet Focus modes make it easy to heat an entire (small- to medium-sized) room or just the couch my husband and I are sitting on, respectively. The portion of the machine that pumps out the air can be tilted up and down depending on where you want to direct its focus, and there\u2019s an oscillation mode that can keep it turning from side to side. And of course, since it\u2019s a Dyson, it\u2019s bladeless and pretty sleek looking. It\u2019s also lightweight so we tote it to whichever room in the house we need it the most, be it upstairs in the bedroom or all the way downstairs in our basement. Combine that with its handy remote that magnetically attaches to the top of the machine and you have an all-year-round staple that gets just as much use in the winter as it does in the summer. \u2013 Valentina Palladino, Deputy Editor $470 at DysonNekteckNekteck Shiatsu Foot Massager Machine with Soothing HeatCold feet? No problem. Instead of simply pulling on a pair of fuzzy socks, give your soles a treat by sticking them into a warm foot massager. Now, I'm a bit of a massage snob myself, and generally find massage chairs, belts and neckbands to be too weak or stiff to be comfortable. But when your entire foot is encased by machinery that can use air and rollers to squeeze and knead all your pressure points, it does feel close enough to an actual massage from human hands. Not only does the simple act of placing your feet in the fabric-lined holes of a box already help warm up your toes, but the stimulation of all the robotic balls and mechanic squeezing results in blood flow that will get you nice and toasty. Throw in the fact that the Nekteck Shiatsu foot massager I recently bought has a heated mode, and even the most reptilian of feet will have an easy time thawing after a 10-minute session. I do have to caution that it takes around three to five cycles to figure out the mode and amount of pressure you like, and that my size 8 feet had enough wiggle room that I could tilt them at angles to get better attention on specific parts of my soles (or avoid getting my tender toes pinched). The larger-footed among us might have a harder time enjoying the Nekteck massager, and those who are generally ticklish or have lower pain thresholds may find the machine too strong, even on the lowest setting. Still, in the week or so that I've owned it, my Nekteck foot massager has strangely become a sight for my sore eyes and feet, and I relish every opportunity to stick my feet in for a quick warm up and hope to see improvements in my general muscle fatigue in time. \u2014 Cherlynn Low, Deputy Editor $70 at AmazonHatch Hatch Restore 2My alarm is set for 6AM three days a week in the ambitious hope that I\u2019ll make it to a 6:30AM yoga class. In the winter, it is midnight-dark at that hour and the only reason I occasionally find myself doing an early morning vinyasa is the sunrise alarm clock feature in the Hatch Restore 2. I schedule mine to start filling the room with a gradually brightening glow about 20 minutes before the sounds of singing bowls start playing. The light helps my brain wake up before I do and the subtle bongs of the bowl sort of seep into my subconscious \u2014 I often find myself awake almost without knowing why. True, there are lots of sunrise alarm clocks out there. Many are cheaper and don\u2019t have an optional subscription tie-in. But I like the Hatch app, which lets you adjust the duration, colors, brightness, volume, tones and so on of your morning alarm. You can also set morning meditations, movements or inspirational pep talks to play after your alarm. These are a couple minutes long and are meant to help you get from horizontal to ambulatory. Of course, if you share a bed and the other person is still asleep, playing motivational dispatches is rude. So I get more mileage out of the sleep aids. Sound baths, ambient soundscapes, stories and guided meditations that help with the transition between the overload that is waking life and sleep. It\u2019s $5 per month for the full library of alarm and sleep sounds and access to all the stories and music. Without it, you only get a selection. I\u2019ve been subscribing for over a year now because anything that gets me up and out to a hellishly early workout in the dark is worth the cash. \u2014 Amy Skorheim, Reporter $170 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$170 at TargetVertefarm Vertefarm Hydroponic Home GardenI\u2019m a city boy with a not-so-green thumb.

Lo and behold, seedlings turned to sprouts which, eventually, turned into gargantuan lettuce plants. There was really no way for me to screw it up. The only downside to this thing?

This time, the company is not only adding new content to the service\u2019s yoga, strength training, and meditation programs, but also offering a new integration with another popular fitness app: Strava.If there\u2019s any problem with Fitness+\u2019s offerings up until this point, it\u2019s that they primarily cater to beginners. Yoga Peak Poses could be one way that changes. Apple is adding yoga retreat-inspired workshops focused on specific, challenging yoga poses like Dancer or Crow. \u201cFor each pose, there\u2019s a 10-minute prep flow to warm users up,\u201d Apple says, followed by a \u201ccorresponding 10-minute practice session.\u201d You can use the workshop to build on your skills and hopefully end up pulling off a tricky pose in the process.If strength training is more your speed, Fitness+ is also getting a new three week-long progressive strength training program Apple has dubbed \u201cThree Perfect Weeks of Strength.\u201d The program is spread across a dozen 30-minute workouts, with the first week focused on \"Progressive Overload,\" the second on \"Time Under Tension,\" and the third on \"Dynamic Power.\" Apple says its designed the program to be repeatable so you can run through it again with different weights as you grow stronger. Don't expect it to be as in-depth as Peloton\u2019s new strength training app, but it\u2019s nice to have more options. AppleOne of the more interesting new additions in this update is how Fitness+ will integrate with Strava. When you share a Fitness+ workout to Strava, the app will now display things like the Fitness+ workout you performed or trainer who led it, on top of your normal health metrics. Apple is offering Strava subscribers up to three months of Fitness+ at no additional costs in a savvy bit of cross-promotion, too.Alongside these new additions is a grab bag of other new features, like an Intro to Breath Meditation class, a selection of workouts designed around training for pickleball, a new slate of Apple's celebrity-led Time to Walk audio stories, and workout playlists focused on Janet Jackson (on January 13), Coldplay (on January 20), Bruno Mars (on January 27) and Kendrick Lamar (on February 3)."},{"title":"MSI also has a 27-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor at CES 2025","text":"When Samsung unveiled the world\u2019s first 27-inch 4K gaming OLED monitor on Thursday, Engadget\u2019s Igor Bonifacic predicted that other vendors would soon follow suit. (After all, Samsung is also the biggest supplier of OLED gaming monitor panels.) Sure enough, MSI followed suit the same day at CES 2025 with two monitors with familiar specs: a 27-inch 4K QD-OLED display and a 27-inch QD-OLED one with a crazy-smooth 500Hz refresh rate.First up: the 27-inch 4K QD-OLED one, marketed to perfection as the\u2026 MPG 272URX QD-OLED. (Sure, why not!) MSI is differentiating its monitor as the first one to combine that panel with DisplayPort 2.1a, which can provide a better combination of resolution and frame rates. Like Samsung\u2019s equivalent (the G81SF), it has a 240Hz refresh rate and should look nice and crisp at 166 PPI.MSI says this panel \u201csignificantly reduces color fringing,\u201d which should help with the poor text clarity too often customary of QD-OLED screens. As my colleague Igor points out, this could be an ideal do-it-all monitor for gaming, work or anything else you can throw at it.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementIt supports NVIDIA\u2019s G-SYNC tech, so smooth gameplay won\u2019t likely be a concern. The MPG 272URX QD-OLED even took home a CES 2025 Innovation Award.The 27-inch QHD QD-OLED model also has a catchy and memorable name: the MPG 272QR QD-OLED X50. (Yes!) MSI is marketing this monitor to \u201call the mainstream gamers out there,\u201d likely due to its lower (2,560 x 1,440) resolution. It also uses DisplayPort 2.1a and (like Samsung\u2019s) can have a 0.03ms gray-to-gray pixel response time.

In a new decision filed today, the Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals has ruled that the FCC does not have the \"statutory authority\" to implement net neutrality rules. The court first blocked the rules in August 2024 when the lawsuit at the center of today's ruling was filed.Net neutrality broadly seeks to prevent internet service provides (ISPs) from giving preferential treatment to specific users or content. That prevents things like a service provider charging a streaming service for faster speeds, or the throttling of a specific website. Every app, website, and user is supposed to be treated equally under net neutrality, making the rules integral to a free, fair and open internet.Since net neutrality rules were first put in place in 2015, the FCC's argument has been that its classification of ISPs as \"telecommunication services\" under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 gives it broad authority to regulate them. The decision to redefine ISPs as \"information services\" during the first Trump Administration led to the repeal of net neutrality in 2017.ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementThe current FCC voted to restore net neutrality on April 25 last year, but the difference between 2015 and now is the Supreme Court's recent, radical reinterpretation of an important legal doctrine. In June 2024, the Supreme Court filed two rulings that overturned the Chevron doctrine, a framework that basically said that if Congress doesn't weigh in on an issue, courts are supposed to defer to the interpretation of government agencies. Now, interpretation falls to the individual judge, and the Sixth Court doesn't agree with the FCC's argument.Net neutrality rules will remain in California and other states, but anything at the federal level will require either an act of Congress or for this case be appealed to (and succeed in front of) the Supreme Court. Engadget has reached out to the FCC to see if it plans on appealing and will update this article if we hear back.\"Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,\" FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement following the ruling. \"With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.\u201d"},{"title":"Nick Clegg is leaving Meta after 7 years overseeing its policy decisions","text":"Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister turned Meta executive, is leaving after a seven-year stint with the social media company.

It even monitors blood oxygen levels, which is something not many trackers do at this price point.The battery life is great, at 13 days, and the IP68 rating means that it should be able to handle being submerged in water, so long as it\u2019s not taken too deep.
